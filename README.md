### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rhys Wells, a Data Generalist who transitioned into the data field after completing my PhD. My current projects focus on learning data science and engineering topics to build a repository of well-understood concepts.

To create and organize my work, I rely on tools like Obsidian to streamline my workflow and spark new ideas. My "Second Brain" is the [Data Archive](https://rhyslwells.github.io/Data-Archive/), where I manage all of this knowledge. In the Data Archive, I use a question-driven approach to guide my curiosity and deepen my understanding. This evolving resource allows for interactive and contextual exploration, going beyond traditional learning methods.

On my [Blog](https://rhyslwells.github.io/), Iâ€™ve shared advice I wish I had known earlier in my career, hoping it helps others on their own journey.

Feel free to explore my projects on GitHub, check out my blog or the Data Archive, or get in touch!
